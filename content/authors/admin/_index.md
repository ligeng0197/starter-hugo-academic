I am a second-year Ph.D. student at the Wangxuan Institute of Computer Technology, Peking University, advised by Prof. Yuxin Peng. My research focuses on Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs/LMMs), with a particular interest in fine-grained perception（CVPR 2025 Highlight / ICLR 2025 Poster）. I am also broadly interested in multimodal reasoning, LLM-based tool use, and embodied agents.
Prior to joining PKU, I received both my Bachelor's and Master's degrees from Harbin Institute of Technology, where I worked with Prof. Hongzhi Wang on meta-learning.
Beyond research, I enjoy playing badminton and exploring the I Ching (周易) — an ancient Chinese classic whose symbolic and philosophical system inspires my thinking about abstraction and reasoning.
