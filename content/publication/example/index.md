abstract: To accelerate learning process with few samples, meta-learning resorts
  to prior knowledge from previous tasks. However, the inconsistent task
  distribution and heterogeneity is hard to be handled through a global sharing
  model initialization. In this paper, based on gradient-based meta-learning, we
  propose an ensemble embedded meta-learning algorithm (EEML) that explicitly
  utilizes multi-model-ensemble to organize prior knowledge into diverse
  specific experts. We rely on a task embedding cluster mechanism to deliver
  diverse tasks to matching experts in training process and instruct how experts
  collaborate in test phase. As a result, the multi experts can focus on their
  own area of expertise and cooperate in upcoming task to solve the task
  heterogeneity. The experimental results show that the proposed method
  outperforms recent state-of-the-arts easily in few-shot learning problem,
  which validates the importance of differentiation and cooperation.
